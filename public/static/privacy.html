You and the other user may disclose a Saved Chatlog or any information shared during the chat. In addition to the Saved Chatlog, it is possible for the other user to take screenshots or use third party software to broadcast or record chats. Be careful with the information you share with a stranger during a chat.</strong></p>

<h2>Video Chat</h2>
<p>Ohmegle video chat service requires a direct connection to be made between your computer and the other user's computer. To do this, it is necessary to make your IP address available to the other user's computer, although it is not shown to the other user by Ohmegle's interface. This is a necessary part of how any P2P video chat system functions. If you are not comfortable with this, use text mode instead.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Ohmegle and its third-party service providers use cookies, tokens, widgets or other similar technologies (collectively “Cookies”) for certain features of the chat services to function. The Cookies collect personal information as follows.</p>
